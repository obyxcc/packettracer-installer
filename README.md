This script will install Cisco's Packet Tracer software on Debian based GNU/Linux distributions.
It aims to fix the issues many people have when installing the .deb file you get from Cisco.

The installation is as simple as downloading the script and running it. It will guide you through the rest.

If you are a new user, run the following command from the directory where you downloaded the script:

I have tested this on a number of distributions that did and did not work from the initial install.

Those of which include:
<ul>
<li>Debian 10</li>
<li>POP!OS 19.10</li>
<li>POP!OS 20.10</li>
<li>ElementaryOS 5.0</li>
<li>Ubuntu 18.04, 18.10, 19.04, and 19.10</li>
<li>Lubuntu 19.04</li>
<li>Xubuntu 18.04 and 19.10</li>
<li>Kali Linux</li>
</ul>

If anyone out there happens to use this on another distro, let me know and I will update the list.

I really hope that this helps you students out there that want to use GNU/Linux in your networking classes.
